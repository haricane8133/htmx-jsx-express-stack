# htmx-jsx-express-stack

This is my attempt at a lightly opinionated boilerplate template for a cookie based authentication, sstorer based session management and Mongo DB enabled NodeJS-Express server serving hypermedia to browsers through HTMX enriched by Alpine.js and Lit.css, with your experience powered by TypeScript, JSX, Nodemon, ESLint, Prettier and Husky; ready to be deployed to DigitalOcean App Platform with complete environment variable support.

There are a lot of things that become easy for you by using this stack.
There are a lot of changes can be made further, and I would be making them when I get time.
